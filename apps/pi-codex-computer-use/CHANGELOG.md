# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### New

- Pi 1.5.0 and later show what changed in this package after you update it.

### Improved

- The package now contains only the files Pi loads and is about half its previous size. Type declarations and source maps are no longer included, and the documentation is no longer included; it remains on GitHub.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-29

### New

- With Computer Use on, `/computer-use-check` now connects to the native service through a temporary runtime and lists apps once, so the report shows whether Computer Use actually answers. No app is operated, and the session's server is not touched.

### Fixed

- Browser Use tasks no longer fail with `The browser access host is unavailable`. Runtime approval dialogs still apply.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-21

### Improved

- The README keeps the setup path and a summary of approval, cancellation, and output limits, and the usage guide owns the detailed rules, including the start conditions and expected result of the browser task.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-21

### Improved

- Logs summarize image sizes without serializing the image payloads.
- After the first connection, sessions start the `cua_repl` server on the first tool call instead of at session start, using a saved tool catalog. Sessions and subagents that never use Computer Use no longer keep an idle server, and session startup no longer waits for it.

### Fixed

- Oversized MCP responses now fail the running call with an error instead of waiting indefinitely for cancellation; the connection stays usable.
- Large runtime errors now follow the same output limit and full-output file handling as other results.
- Unexpected server exits update the footer, and runtime startup/shutdown failures are visible in print/JSON mode.
- Shutdown no longer leaves its turn-notification wait timer active after cleanup.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-20

### Improved

- Source code, issues, and release notes moved to the [pi-packages](https://github.com/buYoung/pi-packages) repository.
- The npm archive includes the usage guide at `docs/usage.md` and `docs/usage.ko.md` instead of under `docs/computer-use/`.
