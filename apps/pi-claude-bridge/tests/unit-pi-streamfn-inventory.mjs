/**
 * Which pi modules can drive our provider.
 *
 * Anything pi hands a `streamFn` can route an LLM call through the registered
 * provider — this one — carrying a system prompt we never recorded. Branch
 * summarization did exactly that and nobody noticed until it started failing
 * turns, because a behavioural contract test can only probe the entry points we
 * already know about; it structurally cannot find the one we don't.
 *
 * So inventory the source instead. Claude Code is closed and has to be probed,
 * but pi ships readable JS in node_modules, and a new consumer showing up there
 * is exactly the thing we want to hear about at bump time rather than from a
 * user. Read the *installed* dist, not reference-code/pi-mono, which can lag
 * behind it.
 *
 * If this fails: a pi upgrade added or moved a streamFn consumer. Work out
 * whether it can reach a bridge model, and either route its cacheRetention:none
 * call to the isolated summary path or add it below with a note on why it is harmless.
